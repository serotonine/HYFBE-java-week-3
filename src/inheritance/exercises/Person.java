/**
 TODO:
 1. Create a superclass Person with fields name and age.
 2. Create subclasses Student and Teacher.
      - Student has field grade (double).
      - Teacher has field subject (String).
 3. Create a method introduce() in Person that prints a generic introduction.
      - Override introduce() in Student and Teacher with specialized messages.
 4. In main():
      - Create a List<Person>.
      - Add multiple Students and Teachers.
      - Loop through the list and call introduce() on each object.
        (Demonstrates polymorphism + inheritance).
